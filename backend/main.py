"""ReplyBy backend.

This exists for one reason: some things cannot happen on the phone. The
Anthropic API key and the fax API key must never ship inside the app, because
anyone can read an app's code. So the phone talks to this server, and this
server is the only thing that holds the keys.

Endpoints arrive over the next few weeks:
  /extract     redacted letter text in, structured facts out   (week 2)
  /explain     confirmed facts in, plain-language summary out  (week 3)
  /draft       findings and timeline in, draft letters out     (week 4)
  /fax         send a signed packet                            (week 5)
  /fax/status  check on a sent fax                             (week 5)

Run it from the repository root:
    .venv/bin/uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
