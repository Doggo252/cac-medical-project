"""Talks to the AI model (Google Gemini) for Reader A.

This is the only file that sends anything to an AI company. By the time text
gets here it has been scrubbed twice: once on the phone (app/src/redact.ts)
and once more in main.py (backend/redact.py).

It uses plain web requests (httpx) rather than Google's own library, to keep
the project's list of add-ons short.
