# IF the person sent the papers after the effective date and on or before the cure deadline (89 days after notice date), AND coverage wasn't restored, THEN the county shall treat it as if it is received timely (Law: W&IC 14005.37(a)., MEDIL I15-22E)
# if papers arrive on the effective date, it counts as satisfying the deadline, because the law or contract typically includes the final day up until its final minute within the permitted timeframe, and a deadline is met as long as performance occurs on or before that specified date
# IF the person sent the papers on or before the effective date, AND they got discontinued anyway, THEN the county must restore Medi-Cal benefits while they  wait for verification (MEDIL I15-22, ACWDL 11-23)

RULES:
One event should contain:
* Date
* What type of event
* description of what happened
* who did the event
* Proof (yes/no), what the proof is
Kinds of events:
* County sent you the letter
* Letter arrived at your house
* You sent papers ---- IF ONLY THIS, MARK AS NEEDS PROOF
* County received papers ---- USE THIS WHEN AVAILABLE
* County sends receipt
* You receive receipt
* Coverage is restored
* Coverage is denied
Proof rule: If someone did it and has no receipt, Rule 1 still fires, but needs proof. It should be relatively easy to keep records using replyby, or make sure to take photo/video proof of sending mail. There may be a mail tracking link that can act as proof.
