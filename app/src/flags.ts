//   - the user chose "keep everything on my phone" (every fact is flagged,
//     since the phone's own reader is less accurate than the AI)
//   - it is empty
//   - the AI said its certainty was "low" (every fact is flagged)
//   - the photo was read with under 70% confidence (every fact is flagged)
//   - the dates do not make sense together
// Plus one more from the same idea: a case number the phone had to repair.
